Implementation of https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rsa.20057[1]  




Run the test with:

./rand_planted_test_threads.py $1 $2

$1 is the number of litrals N.

$2 is the algorithm:
  WP - Warning Propagation.
  BP - Belief Propagation.
  SP - Survey Propagation.


The test is running for random planted SAT and random SAT problems, but can easily change for CNF files.
